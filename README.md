## Hi there 👋 I'm Rutuja — a data storyteller who believes numbers don't lie, but they do love a good narrative.

🔍 I turn messy data into meaningful dashboards and uncover insights that drive real decisions.

💡 What I Do:
- 📊 Power BI Dashboards that speak for themselves
- 🧠 Analytical thinking powered by SQL, Excel, and DAX
- 📁 Data wrangling, cleaning, and exploration
- 📈 Insight-driven reports with a user-first design approach

🚀 Currently Working On:
- Building a portfolio of real-world analytics case studies
- Enhancing automation with Python and Power Query
- Exploring advanced Power BI features 

🛠️ Tech I Use:
`Power BI` • `SQL` • `Excel` • `Python (Pandas)` • `DAX` • `Data Visualization`

✨ Fun Fact:
I don’t just analyze data—I tell its story. Whether it’s customer trends or call center behavior, every chart has a plot twist.
